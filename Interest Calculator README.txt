To solve this solution i wanted to play aroud with winforms so i went with an MVC pattern, i achieved this by separation of  business logic from my form. Then, this enabled me to make my code unit testable. I chose to include some unit testly aslo.
there is also an MSI for the application to be installed and tested.
